* Influx

  Run inferior influx process in Emacs to interact with [[https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/latest/][Influxdb]]

* Installation

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone http://github.com/Manoj321/influx ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/influx
  #+END_SRC

  Add the following to init.el
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/influx/")
  (require 'influx)
  #+END_SRC

* Usage

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  M-x run-influx
  #+END_SRC

* Customizations

  Once the package is loaded calling run-influx should automatically connect to
  influx running on localhost. If influx binary is not in path and you would
  like to connect to a different server do the following.
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq influx-cli-file-path "/usr/local/bin/influx")
  (setq influx-cli-arguments '("-host" "server" "-username" "foo" "-password" "bar" "-precision" "rfc3339"))
  #+END_SRC
